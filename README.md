# Iris_Species_Support_Vector_Machine_Project

We will be using the famous [Iris flower dataset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) to fit a Support Vector Machine to the data with the aim to predict the species of the Iris flowers.  A gridsearch is also performed with an attempt to improve the performance of the model.  Libraries used in this project: Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Pandas.   

The Iris flower dataset or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate dataset introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.   

The dataset consists of 50 samples (150 in total) from each of three Iris species; Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. Four features were measured, in centimeteters, from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.
